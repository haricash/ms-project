This is a repository for storing my data and codes from my MS Project using SDSS-MaNGA with Dr. Yogesh Wadadekar at NCRA

## Quick access

### All tutorials
* [MARVIN Tutorials](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/index.html) : One stop shop for all MARVIN tutorials! 

### Basics

* [DataModels](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/datamodel/datamodels.html) : Discusses the different datamodels (DRP, DAP, Maskbit, VACs, etc)that are accessible 

* [Maps](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tools/utils/plot-map.html#marvin-utils-plot-map) : Useful for custom plotting, masking spaxels for dealing with weird data (negative values and such), etc.

* [Maskbits](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tools/utils/maskbit.html#marvin-maskbit) : Talks about how to work with and use maskbits. This is important because we need to mask some plates which don't satisfy necessary criteria for the problem at hand

* [Extra Catalogs and VACs](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tools/catalogues.html#value-added-catalogs-vacs) : This talks about how we can go about accessing additional catalogs for augmenting our study. Includes NASA Sloan Atlas, DAPall and VACs data. There is also a [seperate link](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/vacs.html) for accessing VACs, but talks about the same thing

* [Spaxels](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tools/spaxel.html#marvin-spaxel) : Helps deal with accessing and working with MaNGA spaxels

## Miscellaneous Links
* [MaNGA Ancillary Observations](https://www.sdss.org/dr15/manga/manga-target-selection/ancillary-targets/) : A description of what, how and why the ancillary data was collected
